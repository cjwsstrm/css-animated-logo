# EA Sports (old?) logo animation in css

## Experimenting with:
- CSS grid
- CSS animations
- Viewport units

## Plans / Ideas:
- [x] Provide input fields to allow user to animate custom text.
- [x] Hook up to [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API) to read out the text.
- [ ] Provide further customization for users, e.g:
  - [ ] setting custom colors for text
  - [ ] allowing emojis or images instead of text
  - [ ] background image or background color
  - [ ] borders
  - [ ] changing the font
- [ ] Add css prefixes and backup properties for proper display in Internet Explorer.
- [x] Fix potential script issues for Internet Explorer.
- [ ] Use project for concept ~~react +~~ wordpress plugin. 
- [ ] Somehow allow user to save the animation as a gif or mp4 (This looks surprisingly hard and might require rebuilding the animation on canvas or something like that.)
